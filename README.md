# Module 1 Final Project

In this project, I’m trying to answer some questions from a big company which is trying to make its first
movie. The company wants to know what type of movies are currently doing the best at the box office. 
To answer this question, I evaluted the effects of movies’ Genre, Popularity, and IMDb Rate on the
domestic and global revenue. For this, I scraped data from IMDb’s website. I‘ve selected 1,500 movies
that were released from January 1 st 2010 through January 1 st 2020 in the USA, which have high
Popularity. To answer these questions, I first reviewed and cleaned up my data set. Then I examined the
relation and interaction between the fields in my dataset, using the Pearson and Spearman correlations.
For the next step, I tried to find the top ten popular and the top 5 profitable genres.
